# DokuWiki Note plugin

A plugin for DokuWiki which allows users to easily insert four kinds of notes into the wiki pages.

## Authors

The plugin has been written from scratch by Olivier Cortéz. After the initial release it has been maintained by Olivier while he integrated several patches provided by the DokuWiki-community. Somewhere around the end of 2008 / start of 2009 Olivier started to became too busy with other (real-life) activities and occupations that active development and support halted. On 2009/06/15 Aurélien Bompard decided, after contacting Olivier Cortéz about it, to (temporarily) take-over maintenance and support for the plugin. On the same date Mischa The Evil opened a GitHub-repository for the plugin to make it a "real" community plugin. On the 16th a re-packaged release is available which "completed" the plugin (doc, license etc.)..
